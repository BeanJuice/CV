  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Learning, mostly coding/computer science stuff, join me on my hacking journey over at Hack The Box!</li>
    <li>Coding isn't my only hobby! I also facet gems, which is to say I take rocks, cut and polish them to make them into stones worthy of something you'd wear on a ring or necklace. Ask me about this if you read this far</li>
    <li>Watching cooking shows like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bkd0LxBd2L8">Binging with Babish</a> and Great British Bake-off help me to relax in the evenings at the house</li>
